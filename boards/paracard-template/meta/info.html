<h1>Parallella</h1>
<h2>Expansion Board</h2>

<p>This project template may be used as the basis for expansion boards for the
<a href="http://www.parallella.org/" target="blank">Parallella PCB.</a></p>

<p>This project includes a schematic defining all IO from the Parallella
PCB.  The user may select any or all of the connectors depending on need
for the application, simply by including or deleting the associated schematic
symbol at the top level.  Also included is a PCB of the same size as the
Parallella PCB with connectors placed correctly to align the two boards.
All IO and power rails present on the Parallella are connected to the
daughtercard through the 0.5mm Samtec BSH expansion headers.</p>

<p>The board looks like the following:</p>
