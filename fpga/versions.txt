  The ESYSINFO register, readable from the ARM host, allows software
to determine what hardware platform it is running on and what
features are available.  There are four 8-bit fields:

  FPGAID[31:24]   - Generation
  FPGAID[23:16]   - Platform, defines the components and connections
                    on the PCB.
  FPGAID[15:8]    - Type, defines features included in FPGA
  FPGAID[7:0]     - Revision #, incremented on each change

A given PCB assembly can generally only use FPGA configurations 
corresponding to that platform.  Sometimes the same FPGA config might 
work on multiple platforms, e.g. a config that doesn't use GPIO could 
be used on a board that has or doesn't have GPIO connectors, however 
for consistency it is desireable to create separate configurations for
each platform so a user can always know what hardware platform [s]he has.

Note that TYPE definitions may change with different generations and
possibly with different platforms, but where possible they will be kept
consistent at least within a platform.

Within each FPGA project this register value is set by a version.v file,
it is VERY IMPORTANT that this file be updated as needed whenever changes
are made to the code.

ADDITIONS to this file must be synchronized with the master spreadsheet
on dropbox and pushed down to the documentation and source code.
